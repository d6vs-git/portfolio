D6VS is a focused digital product studio that helps founders, startups and teams turn ideas into real products. We combine product thinking, human-centered design, and pragmatic engineering to deliver web and mobile experiences — and layer in AI features where they add real value. From discovery and prototyping to development, deployment, and ongoing iteration, we partner with you to ship useful, delightful, and maintainable products.

## Mission
We make digital ideas tangible. Our mission is to help visionary teams move from concept to impact quickly — with clarity, quality, and measurable outcomes. We value speed without sacrificing craftsmanship.

## What we do
- Product strategy & discovery — clarify goals, users, and success metrics.
- UI/UX design — craft intuitive, accessible, and beautiful interfaces.
- Web application development — React/Next.js frontends and Node backends.
- Mobile app development — cross-platform solutions (Flutter / React Native).
- AI & ML features — prototype and integrate AI to automate, personalize, and analyze.
- DevOps & hosting — CI/CD, Docker, and managed deployments.
- Ongoing support & growth — monitoring, performance tuning, and feature roadmaps.

- **Maintenance & Support:** SLA-driven support, security patches, and feature iteration.

## Typical process (6 steps)
1. **Discover** — Short discovery sessions to understand users, metrics, and constraints. Output: problem statement, success metrics, and a lightweight roadmap.
2. **Plan & Prototype** — Wireframes and prototypes validate interface and flow quickly. Output: clickable prototype, tech plan, and effort estimate.
3. **Design** — Visual design, UX refinements, accessibility checks, and a design system for reuse. Output: design assets, components, and specs.
4. **Build** — Incremental, testable development with continuous demos. Output: working product, tests, and deployable artifacts.
5. **Launch** — Deploy to production, monitor analytics, and stabilize performance. Output: live product and deployment runbook.
6. **Iterate** — Analyze user feedback and metrics, prioritize improvements, and release updates often.
